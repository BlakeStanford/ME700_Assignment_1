Generative AI was used sparingly in this project as a reference source. 

Use 1: refresher on OOP structure and syntax.
ie. 
"How can I properly store a global function as an attribute of a class?"

ie.
"Please guide me through the process of creating and pushing to a git repo via the command line"
